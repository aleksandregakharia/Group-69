    <h2>Main antoganist</h2>
    <p>Guram Vakhtangashvili</p>
    <p>stand - killer queen</p>
    <p>ability - expload everything it touch</p>
    <p>His name is Guram Vakhtangashvili. He is 16 years old. He lives in the center of Tbilisi, in a quiet residential
        area surrounded by old villas and tree-lined streets. He is not in a relationship. He’s a student and also works
        part-time at the Kame Yu department stores. Every day, he gets home by 8 PM at the latest. He doesn’t smoke, but
        he does drink on rare occasions—nothing excessive.</p>
    <p>He goes to bed at 11 PM and always makes sure to get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. Before sleeping, he
        drinks a glass of warm milk and does about twenty minutes of stretches. Thanks to that, he usually has no
        trouble sleeping through the night and wakes up in the morning without any fatigue or stress. Like a baby. At
        his last check-up, he was told he’s perfectly healthy.</p>
    <p>He tries to live a quiet life. He avoids getting involved in unnecessary drama or competition—things like
        winning or losing that might disturb his peace of mind. That’s how he deals with the world around him, and he
        believes that’s what brings him </p>
    <p>However... if he were to fight, he wouldn't lose to anyone.</p>
